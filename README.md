#######3Project Introduction

The dataset we are working with comes from a detailed study on Alzheimer's Disease in elderly patients. It includes information on people aged 60 to 90 from different backgrounds and education levels. The data covers a wide range of factors such as BMI, smoking habits, alcohol use, physical activity, diet, sleep quality, medical history, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, cognitive test scores (like MMSE), and various symptoms and diagnoses related to Alzheimer's Disease.

Our main goal is to build models that can predict whether someone will be diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease based on this information. We'll use different types of classification algorithms, like logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, to do this. We will also look for the most important factors that influence the risk of getting Alzheimer's. The results from this work could help in detecting Alzheimer's Disease early and improving how it is managed and treated.
